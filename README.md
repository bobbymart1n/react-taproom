# React Angular Project Clone
**A React project for Epicodus 07.05.18**

## By Bobby Martin

## Description
This is a Friday project for Epicodus. The objective is to take an existing Angular project we've done, and turn it into a React application. I think some of the differences I'll be facing are parsing out components compared to how they are laid out in the Angular version. Also where that data lies and how I need to be passing it down to whatever corresponding children.

## Setup Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Notes
* Component Flow  
![Component Flow](src/images/project-flow-3.png)
* As I was building out the flow chart, I have been trying to figure out how I want to split up the views and not have all of them on one view.
* So far I haven't really come across any unexpected challenges. I'm sure I'll run into some hiccups when implementing state. If I had to say something about the work so far, its that I have somewhat lost the mindset of how Angular projects are structured. I feel like React makes a lot more sense to me in the way you structure an application. All that said, I obviously don't know everything, but there is something about React that feels more comfortable.
* I feel like the structure of the app so far is how I want it. Though I think there might be a restructure happening when implementing state. We will see.


## Technologies
* React
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Webpack
