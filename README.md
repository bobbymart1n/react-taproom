# React Angular Project Clone
**A React project for Epicodus 06.29.18**

## By Bobby Martin

## Description
This is a Friday project for Epicodus. The objective is to take an existing Angular project we've done, and turn it into a React application. I think some of the differences I'll be facing are parsing out components compared to how they are laid out in the Angular version. Also where that data lies and how I need to be passing it down to whatever corresponding children.
